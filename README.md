# MRG-Bioinformatics
Current list of work being carried out in the MRG in Bioinformatics


# Short Term Work
## Jess Tarn / Dennis Lendrem
* GLM Code support - Useful collaboration for Arthur's eQTL Projects

# Long Term Projects
## Faye Cooles - NanoString
* Evaluate Raw Data Distribution
* Design model for experimental design
* Assess suitability of DESeq2 as analysis framework for NanoString Data
* Develop Contrasts
* Visualisations
* Export Results
* Rubber Duck
* Send results

## Fai Ng
### Resolve Therapeutics - qPCR Arrays
* Evaluate Raw Data
* Assess batch effects and suitability of combining Data
* Re-run against original analysis
* Rubber Duck
* Report results

### Tenascin C Project
* Extract Gene expression data in Discovery and Validation data sets
* Test for correlations against phenotype data (waiting for clinical phenotypes of interest)
* Rubber Duck
* Report results

### MSc Supervision
* Weekly meeting to assess progress and guide
* Low Frequency support

## Stuart Watson
### Methylation Arrays
* Report results of non-linear effects
* Waiting on Stuart to confirm sample-to-sample matchings

## John Loughlin
### arcOGEN Data
* Phenotype data requested, waiting on response
* Imputed (1000G Phase 1, GRCh37 Assembly) Data requested, waiting on response

### Jaume Machine Learning
* Test Machine Learning Results against Linear Model tests for differential methylation
* Expectation is that some combinations from Jaume may not be found using typical differential methylation techniques

## Louise Reynard
### Methylation Collaboration Project
* Scripps Transcription Factor Enrichment Analysis
* Mandy Transcription Factor Enrichment Analysis
  * MSC - chondrocyte
  * MSC - OB
  * MSC - Tenocyte
  * Subset for Final CpG list for original collaboration
* Compile Code for Project
* Migrate to long term github Project
* Document

### Data Queries
* Gene Expression Query from Arthur's Datasets - CD4+/CD8+ for CHST11
* Genotype Query from Arthur's Datasets - See email for list

### mQTL Analysis
* mQTL Pipeline Design (use parts from Arthur's project)
* Combine Preprocessed Genotype Data - From Rebecca
* Genotype Raw IDAT files (need GenomeStudio, CRLMM is not viable)
* Impute Genotyped IDAT files (1000G Phase 3)

## Sophie Hambleton
### PID Exome Project
* Re-label mixed samples
* Re-run Joint Genotyping
* Create test that checks relatedness against known pedigrees

## Colin Shepherd
### Data request
* NOF OA RNA Seq data for genes of interest
  * Find transcript ID to gene ID mappings
  * Get TPMs
  * Send results

## Arthur Pratt
### T-Cell Dataset
* Query - See email, differential expression test between groupings
* GLM / LM differences based on - x ~ y * z / LRT
* eQTL of ~1000 Genes (ranked by variability), benchmark time in 30 cores parallel
* Interaction effect research

### B-Cell
* No current Tasks

## Desa Lilic
### CiC Project
* Awaiting Data - Expected mid to end of July

## David Young
### NOF OA RNA Seq Dataset
* Genotyping Analysis Results

### 1000 Families miRNA Seq
* No current Tasks
* Expecting Data

### DNA Sequencing
* No current Tasks
* Expecting email about meeting

### Cardiff collaboration
* Low frequency support requests
