# MRG-Bioinformatics
Current list of work being carried out in the MRG in Bioinformatics

---

# Long Term Projects
## Faye Cooles - NanoString
* Differential Expression
  * IGS split by RA/Healthy - Check.
  * All the combinations.
* Assess suitability of DESeq2 as analysis framework for NanoString Data
  * Check NanoStringNorm, and normalise using housekeepers (geometric mean)
  * Limma Voom (Don't pre normalise - Size factors, or TMM at most)
* IPA Training / Teaching


---

## Fai Ng
### Resolve Therapeutics - qPCR Arrays
* Evaluate Raw Data
* Assess batch effects and suitability of combining Data
* Re-run against original analysis
* Rubber Duck
* Report results

---

## Stuart Watson
### Methylation Arrays
* Inspect Gender specific effects
* Waiting on Stuart to confirm sample-to-sample matchings
* Compare SWAN against FunNorm
* Reply to Abstract Query

---

## John Loughlin
### Jaume Machine Learning
* Test Machine Learning Results against Linear Model tests for differential methylation
* Expectation is that some combinations from Jaume may not be found using typical differential methylation techniques

---

## Louise Reynard
### Methylation Collaboration Project
* Compile Code for Project
* Migrate to long term github Project
* Document

### mQTL Analysis
* mQTL Pipeline Design (use parts from Arthur's project)
  * Bespoke
  * MatrixEQTL (CRAN)
* Combine Preprocessed Genotype Data - From Rebecca
* Genotype Raw IDAT files (need GenomeStudio, CRLMM is not viable)
* Impute Genotyped IDAT files (1000G Phase 3)

### GEO Data request
* GSE80071
  * Awaiting Contrasts of interest

---

## Sophie Hambleton
### PID Exome Project
* Create Test to detect duplicate sample IDs in pedigree file, that have different family IDs
* Find a solution to multiple patient samples in a single run (DNA / Fibroblasts)
* Alter Pedigree file for mismatches
* Rerun full JointGenotyping Run

---

## Arthur Pratt
### T-Cell Dataset
* Query - See email, differential expression test between groupings
* Phil - Methotrexate Queries
  * Add to phenotype data
* Add extraction Dates to data
  * Some kind of effect, but not as well encapsulated as current factors
* Paper Amendments
  * HLA-DRB6
    * Get Probe Quality information
    * 2 Probes available in annotation
    * Lots of SNPs
      * ILMN_2066060 - 11 Overlapping SNPs in 50bp capture seq
      * ILMN_2066066 - 6 Overlapping SNPs in 50bp capture seq
  * B-Cell Expression set
    * Run through Pipeline
    * Find a way to deal with RPS26 Chromosome patch
  * Incorporate MAF in somehow.


### B-Cell Dataset
* Support / teaching of Nish's PhD

---

## Desa Lilic
### CiC Project
* Volcano Plots - Make X Axis Static (-10:10?)
* Perform set union for IFNa and IFNg: (CMCa - CMCu) âˆª (HCa - HCu)
  * Check Direction of FC
* Repeat analysis for Fibroblasts
* IFNa Inducible genes from papers sent by Desa
  * Plot - Display between conditions.

---

## David Young
### NOF OA RNA Seq Dataset
* Genotyping Analysis Results

### 1000 Families miRNA Seq - Tania/Fraser
* Get Raw Data - Awaiting Fastq Files
* Publication Quality Tables and Figures

### DNA Sequencing
* No current Tasks
* Expecting email about meeting

### Cardiff collaboration
* Low frequency support requests

---

## Amanda Villalvilla

---

## Drew Rowan
### GEO Upload - Roughly ~0.5 Days
* Waiting on Details from Matt.
* Build GEO Archive
* Send to Curators
* Get GEO Accession
  * Forward to Drew
* Hold accession until specified
