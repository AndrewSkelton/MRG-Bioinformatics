# MRG-Bioinformatics
Current list of work being carried out in the MRG in Bioinformatics

---

## Jess Tarn / Dennis Lendrem
* GLM Code support - Useful collaboration for Arthur's eQTL Projects
* Normalised, not batch corrected dataset

---

# Long Term Projects
## Faye Cooles - NanoString
* Evaluate Raw Data Distribution
* Design model for experimental design - Question 5 still to go
* Assess suitability of DESeq2 as analysis framework for NanoString Data
  * Check NanoStringNorm, and normalise using housekeepers (geometric mean)
  * Limma Voom (Don't pre normalise - Size factors, or TMM at most)
* Volcano Plots
* Pairings
* Correlation of Retrotransposon genes against everything else (cor.test)
  * Subset by Cell Type
* Rubber Duck
* Send results

---

## Fai Ng
### Resolve Therapeutics - qPCR Arrays
* Evaluate Raw Data
* Assess batch effects and suitability of combining Data
* Re-run against original analysis
* Rubber Duck
* Report results

### Tenascin C Project
* Extract Gene expression data in Discovery and Validation data sets
* Test for correlations against phenotype data (waiting for clinical phenotypes of interest)
* Rubber Duck
* Report results

### MSc Supervision
* Weekly meeting to assess progress and guide
* Low Frequency support

---

## Stuart Watson
### Methylation Arrays
* Inspect Gender specific effects
* Waiting on Stuart to confirm sample-to-sample matchings

---

## John Loughlin
### arcOGEN Data
* Finish Transfer using Globus Online
* Archive to Sulaco / MRG Archive
* Followup Britt - Phenotype FTP error

### Jaume Machine Learning
* Test Machine Learning Results against Linear Model tests for differential methylation
* Expectation is that some combinations from Jaume may not be found using typical differential methylation techniques

---

## Louise Reynard
### Methylation Collaboration Project
* Compile Code for Project
* Migrate to long term github Project
* Document

### Data Queries
* Gene Expression Query from Arthur's Datasets - CD4+/CD8+ for CHST11
* Genotype Query from Arthur's Datasets - See email for list

### mQTL Analysis
* mQTL Pipeline Design (use parts from Arthur's project)
* Combine Preprocessed Genotype Data - From Rebecca
* Genotype Raw IDAT files (need GenomeStudio, CRLMM is not viable)
* Impute Genotyped IDAT files (1000G Phase 3)

---

## Sophie Hambleton
### PID Exome Project
* Implement check for Missing bam files for a given sample map element
* Re-run Joint Genotyping - Waiting on preprocessing.
* Create test that checks relatedness against known pedigrees

---

## Arthur Pratt
### T-Cell Dataset
* Query - See email, differential expression test between groupings
* GLM / LM differences based on - x ~ y * z / LRT
* eQTL of ~1000 Genes (ranked by variability), benchmark time in 30 cores parallel
* Interaction effect research

### B-Cell Dataset
* No current Tasks
* Support / teaching of Nish's PhD

---

## Desa Lilic
### CiC Project
* Awaiting Data - Expected mid to end of July

---

## David Young
### NOF OA RNA Seq Dataset
* Genotyping Analysis Results

### 1000 Families miRNA Seq - Tania/Fraser
* Get Raw Data
* Publication Quality Tables and Figures

### DNA Sequencing
* No current Tasks
* Expecting email about meeting

### Cardiff collaboration
* Low frequency support requests
